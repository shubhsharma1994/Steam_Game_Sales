# Steam_Game_Sales
In this project analyzed the sales of video game on Steam. Steam is essentially an online channel which facilitates buying and selling of video games.  It is relevant to game developers planning proprietary software projects. 
We analyzed parameters affecting the success of the game. In order to quantify the success of video game we took number of owners or downloads as the measure of success, as more the number of downloads, more the video game will earn, be it through pricing or in-app purchases or downloadable content.
We used text and image data to generate insights. Using topic modeling we identified top 6 topics in the descriptions. To achieve this, we used Latent Dirichlet Allocation using NLTK. We also extracted contrast and brightness of the icon images by using appropriate image transformations. 
Finally, we regressed all the variables – brightness, contrast, probability allocated to topics, categorical and numerical predictors against the dependent variable – number of owners and found that number of owners is positively related to factors such as achievements and leaderboards and it is negatively related to price.
We made stratergies for Action genre game by identifying right topics of description, should it priced or not and should it have in-app purchases or not.
